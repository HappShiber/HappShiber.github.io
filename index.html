        <h1 style="font-family:verdana">Travel to London, Ontario</h1>
       
        <p  style="font-family:'Courier New'"><strong>London, Ontario is a beautiful region full of infastructure and cigarette butts. Everywhere you walk, you'll see lines of identical houses and factories pumping out enough smoke to shield the sun's rays for days.</strong></p>

        <img src="https://i.redd.it/0yseondvleq11.jpg" width=300 alt="An average day in London"> <img src="https://www.londonpolice.ca/en/crime-prevention/resources/images/banner-roadclosed.jpg" width=522 alt="A beautiful sight in London"> <img src="https://assets.site-static.com/userFiles/1285/image/Summerside-Neighbourhood-London.jpg" width=372 alt="A beatiful sight in London">

        <p><em>A couple of sights in London, Ontario. Don't get your hopes up! These are much nicer than anything you'll see when you actually visit. (If you do, that is.)</em></p>

        <h2 style="font-family:verdana">A place like no other, probably for a reason.</h2>

        <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><strong>London, Ontario doesn't have much to visually offer but it makes up for it in its' amazing activities! Whether it's visiting the local mall or going to the high-tech vet to put down your elderly dog, you'll always come across a squirrel or two, flat as a pancake on the road to lighten up your day!</strong></p>

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/WhiteOaksMall.JPG" width=700 alt="White Oaks Mall in London">

        <p><em>White Oaks Mall. Really not much to see here, keep scrolling down. We might have more to impress you.</em></p>

        <h2 style="font-family:verdana">Why someone like you would visit London, Ontario.</h2>

        <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><strong>I've never know anyone that has visited London to see anyone else other than family, so if you don't have family then don't visit. But, if you're the one person on the planet that has any desire to actually come here, try to get yourself adopted into a family so you can finally have a reason to come down to this landfill of a town.</strong></p>
