        <p>Masutatsu Oyama was a Korean karate practitionner who created the style of karate now known as KyokushinKai. He began studying martial arts at age 9, and by the age of 15, he had 4th degree or higher blackbelts in Shotokan Karate, Goju-Ryu Karate and Judo. After founding Kyokushin, Mas Oyama completed the 100-man kumite (fighting 1 person for 2 minutes, then immediately fighting another, 100 times) 3 days in a row without losing a single fight. Even on the third day, anyone that tried to block him had their bones broken. He also fought 52 bulls to demonstrate his strength, the majority of which died after a single blow to the head. He did not smoke but unfortunately died of lung cancer at the age of 70 in 1994.</p>

        <h2 class="alignment hover1"><center><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyokushin" target="blank"> What is KyokushinKai Karate </a></center></h2>
        <p>Kyokushin is a style of karate originating from the teachings of founder Masutatsu Oyama, more commonly known as Sosai (meaning founder) Mas Oyama. The Kyokushin organisation was founded in 1964, and its style is based around <strong>street-fighting.</strong> It is a combination of many martial arts, taking the best from all of the practices. The headquarters is located in Toyko, Japan, although Kyokushin has spread over 120 countries worldwide, making it one of the biggest styles of karate in history. In 1969, the first Kyokushin tournament was held, with the victor being Terutomo Yamazaki. Unfortunately, Oyama passed away in 1994 without naming a successor. Eventually after lots of difficulty, IKO (International Karate Organisation) named Shokei Matsui the head, though many claim to by the rightful heir, and have created multiple sub-organisations of Kyokushin, such is IKO2, IKO3, etc.</p>

    <h2>Why I got into Kyokushin</h2>

    <p>At the time of writing this, I have been practicing Kyokushin for almost a year and a half. I have an orange belt and am on track to recieve my blue belt during the summer. I joined because I felt I needed more physical activity in my life. At the time of joining, I couldn't do a pushup or a pull-up, but now I can do 45 push-ups in a row and ~5 pull-ups. At the time of writing this, I am doing a 2000 push-up challenge to raise money for mental health as part of my dojos team. I have completed around 1600 already, and I've got 2 days left. I have raised ~$300, and it is great to improve my skills and physical health.</p>

    <h2>My first Karate Tournament in Kitchener</h2>

        <p class=centerline>In my first 6 months of joining my dojo, I made the decision to participate in the regional tournament in Kata. I was one of 2 white belts in the entire tournament, and there was upwards of 300 competitors. I ended up placing 2nd in my catagory, doing much better than I expected. It was a great day and I still have my trophy in my room.</p>

    <h2>Should you join Kyokushin?</h2>

    <p>Don't get me wrong, this style of karate is hard to learn and you will get hurt in the process, but you will greatly improve in strength and you'll experience a new sense of self-discipline and hard work you can apply to the rest of your life. Kyokushin, The Ultimate Truth.</p>
